Practice TOEFL speaking task #1 (personal choice question) with this app.

The repository contains a txt file with a certain amount of questions available. The algorithm chooses a random question out of the list, asks it outloud and then gives you time to prepare and answer.

The app will run until you press Ctrl + C to terminate it.
